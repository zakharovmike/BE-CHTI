#### Anna Wadsten & Mikhail Zakharov

Completed:

- 1.1
- 2.1
- 2.2

In progress: **3**

TODO:

* Check that M2TIR is correct (and maybe adjust to slightly lower than 50 mV)
* Find out how to test properly with GFSSP
* Add a way to track number of validated hits per frequency
* Create condition to reset hit_validated
* Figure out what happens to hits_per_frequency when a hit is validated

Up next: speed optimization, space optimization
